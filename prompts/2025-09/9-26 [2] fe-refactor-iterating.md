I've saved your design draft to the file: dev-notes/2025-09/9-26 ws-fe-handler-client-refactor-draft.md

I have a bunch of comments / thoughts / qeustions. Let's start with one of the easier ones:

## Proposal: Simplify `createExampleClient`, just return `client`

I think we can get rid of the object we are creating in createExampleClient and just return `client` directly.

* The `join/leave` room methods are dumb pass throughs that don't add anything.
* I don't like the curernt `subscribe` / `dispose` pattern. We could maybe just add a `removeHandler(s)` method to `WsClient`?
  - I'm not sure if we will even be removing handlers, but we add a simple helper to the client class for now.
* Let's move the domain specific `sendChat` helper out of `example.ts`. I'm thinking another domain-specific file like `chat/ws-actions.ts`. And maybe rename `chat/actions.ts` to `chat/state-actions.ts`?

```ts
// chat/ws-actions.ts -- possible implementation
// NOTE: maybe merge this `chat/messages.ts ???

import { createSendMessage } from './messages';

function createChatWsActions(client: WsClient) {
  return {
    postNewMessage: (roomId: string, text: string) => {
      client.send(createSendMessage(text, roomId));
    },
  };
}
```

## Prompt

Let me know what you think of the above idea. Critiques / concerns, additional related improvements, etc. Be honest and don't flatter me. Once we are aligned, let's update the deisgn doc.
